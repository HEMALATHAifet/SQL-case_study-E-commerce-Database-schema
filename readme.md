# üõçÔ∏è **E-Commerce Database Schema ‚Äî SQL Case Study**

## üéØ **Objective**

The goal of this case study is to design and analyze a database for an online shopping platform.
It manages customers, products, orders, payments, shipments, and reviews ‚Äî replicating real-world e-commerce operations.

This project demonstrates **database design, normalization, and SQL analytics** skills.

| **Products**    | All available products                        |
| **Orders**      | Master table for each purchase                |
| **Order_Items** | Details of each product purchased in an order |
| **Payments**    | Payment details for each order                |
| **Shipments**   | Shipping status and tracking                  |

## üíæ **2. Database Schema (SQL)**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    phone VARCHAR(15),
    address VARCHAR(200)
);

CREATE TABLE Categories (
    category_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    category_name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    category_id INT,
    price DECIMAL(10,2),
    stock_qty INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES Categories(category_id)
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    total_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    status VARCHAR(20),
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)
);

CREATE TABLE Order_Items (

    order_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    quantity INT,
    price DECIMAL(10,2),
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES Orders(order_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES Products(product_id)
);

CREATE TABLE Payments (
    payment_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT,
    payment_method VARCHAR(20),

    customer_id INT,
    rating INT CHECK (rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5),
    comment VARCHAR(255),

## üßÆ **3. Sample Business Queries**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Total revenue by month

```sql
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS month,
    SUM(total_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM Orders
GROUP BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date)
ORDER BY month;
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Top 5 best-selling products

```sql
SELECT 
    p.name, 
    SUM(oi.quantity) AS total_sold
FROM Order_Items oi
JOIN Products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.name
ORDER BY total_sold DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Average customer spending

```sql
SELECT 
    c.name, 
    SUM(o.total_amount) AS total_spent
FROM Customers c
JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.name
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Inventory low stock check

```sql
SELECT name, stock_qty 
FROM Products
WHERE stock_qty < 10;
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Average product rating

```sql
SELECT 
    p.name,
    ROUND(AVG(r.rating),2) AS avg_rating
FROM Reviews r
JOIN Products p ON r.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.name
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC;
```

## üìä **4. Analytical Insights**

1. **Sales Trend:**
   Revenue peaks during festive months (Nov‚ÄìDec).

2. **Customer Insights:**
   10% of customers contribute ~60% of total sales (Pareto Principle).

3. **Product Insights:**
   Electronics and Accessories categories dominate revenue.

4. **Inventory:**
   Several products show low stock ‚Äî restocking can prevent missed sales.

5. **Customer Experience:**
   Products with average ratings below 3 require quality or service improvement.
